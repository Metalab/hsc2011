Run `make` to install.

configure/build/install time requirements: GNU make and coreutils

run-time requirements: a webserver (example configuration for Apache httpd 2.2
is in the `etc` directory), a sensible graphical browser with JavaScript
(tested with Firefox 4 only so far, targetting Chromium 12 and Opera 11 later)
